# Dart Package Review with Pana

## Prerequisites

Before running pana, ensure it's installed:

```bash
# Check if pana is installed
command -v pana
```

If not installed, run the installation script:

```bash
bash scripts/install_pana.sh
```

Or install manually:

```bash
dart pub global activate pana
```

## Quick start

Run pana on the current package:

```bash
pana .
```

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Package Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Verify pana installation
- [ ] Step 2: Run pana analysis
- [ ] Step 3: Identify scoring issues
- [ ] Step 4: Categorize by severity
- [ ] Step 5: Suggest resolutions
- [ ] Step 6: Apply fixes (with user confirmation)
- [ ] Step 7: Verify improvements
```

**Step 1: Verify pana installation**

Check that pana is available. If not, use `scripts/install_pana.sh`.

**Step 2: Run pana analysis**

Execute `pana .` and review the output. The tool scores packages on:
- Dart file conventions (30 points)
- Documentation (20 points)
- Platform support (20 points)
- Static analysis (50 points)
- Dependencies (40 points)

**Step 3: Identify scoring issues**

Look for sections marked with ✗ or [~] (partial credit). Parse the output for:
- Critical: Missing files, invalid pubspec, analysis failures
- Warnings: Platform compatibility, documentation gaps
- Suggestions: Topics, examples, description improvements

**Step 4: Categorize by severity**

**Critical Issues** (must fix):
- Package score below 100
- Missing README, CHANGELOG, or LICENSE
- Invalid pubspec.yaml
- Failing static analysis

**Warnings** (should fix):
- Platform compatibility issues (especially WASM)
- Documentation coverage below 20%
- Outdated dependencies

**Suggestions** (nice to have):
- Add topics to pubspec
- Improve package description
- Add more examples

**Step 5: Suggest resolutions**

For each issue, provide:
1. Clear explanation of the problem
2. Specific fix recommendation
3. Example code or command if applicable

**Step 6: Apply fixes**

Ask user for confirmation before making changes. Present as:
```
Issue: [description]
Fix: [specific action]
Apply? (yes/no)
```

**Step 7: Verify improvements**

Re-run `pana .` and compare scores. Iterate if issues remain.

## Common issues and fixes

### Missing files

**README.md**: Create with standard structure (title, description, installation, usage, license)

**CHANGELOG.md**: Use Keep a Changelog format:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-01
### Added
- Initial release
```

**LICENSE**: Add MIT, BSD, or appropriate license file

### Platform compatibility

Common issues:
- **WASM incompatibility**: Usually caused by `dart:io` imports. Use conditional exports to provide platform-specific implementations.
- **Platform-specific APIs**: Abstract platform-specific code behind interfaces with conditional imports.

### Static analysis failures

Run `dart analyze` and fix all issues before re-running pana.

### Documentation coverage

Add dartdoc comments to public APIs:
```dart
/// Returns the user's display name.
/// 
/// Returns null if the user has not set a display name.
String? getDisplayName() { ... }
```

## Examples

### Example 1: WASM compatibility issue

**Pana output:**
```
## ✗ Platform support (10 / 20)
Package not compatible with runtime wasm

Because:
* `package:myapp/main.dart` that imports:
* `package:example_package/example_package.dart` that imports:
* `dart:io`
```

**Fix:**
Replace the problematic package with conditional exports:
```dart
// Create platform-specific implementations and export conditionally
export 'my_class_native.dart' 
    if (dart.library.js) 'my_class_web.dart';
```

### Example 2: Missing documentation

**Pana output:**
```
20% or more of the public API has dartdoc comments
45 out of 200 API elements (22.5%) have documentation comments
```

**Fix:**
Add documentation to undocumented elements:
```dart
// Before
class User {
  String? name;
  int? age;
}

// After
/// Represents a user in the system.
class User {
  /// The user's display name.
  String? name;
  
  /// The user's age in years.
  int? age;
}
```

### Example 3: Formatting issues

**Pana output:**
```
lib/main.dart doesn't match the Dart formatter
```

**Fix:**
```bash
dart format .
```
